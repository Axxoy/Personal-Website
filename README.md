# Personal-Website
The first version of my personal website (axoy.me), which serves as a short introduction about myself, who I am and links to socials.



# 🔗 [Axoy.me](https://www.axoy.me)

I wanted to create a minimal yet modern looking webpage that combines my interest for graphic design, computer science, and functional design all into one.

This is version 1.0, made completely from scratch, without the use of any templates.

<br>

✨ Pretty happy with how it turned out. I tried implementing a responsive design as much as I could.

<br>

🚀 Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

❕ Note: Make sure you download & install Comfortaa Font to ensure everything appears as intended.
